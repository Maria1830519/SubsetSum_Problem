# SubsetSum_Problem
Can a subset of numbers within a set that sums to a particular target value? This program gets a set of numbers and also receives an expected sum x as an input from the user.

The program does two different calculations: First, checks if there is a combination of numbers within the subset whose sum is the expected sum. Second, if there is no subset sum that gets that number, the program returns the subset whose sum has the smallest difference possible from all the possible combinations.
